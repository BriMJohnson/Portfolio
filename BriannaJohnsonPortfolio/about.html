                    <p>Hi! My name is Brianna Johnson. I am a Sophomore <br>
                        Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T <br>
                        University. I specialize in Front-end development and Graphic <br>
                        Design. Growing up in predominantly white spaces, I <br>
                        never had the opportunity to see individuals who look like <br>
                        me in certain positions. However, by pursuing my passion<br>
                        for technology in a field with little diversity, I hope <br>
                        to shatter barriers and debunk stereotypes. With my strong work <br>
                        ethics, I aim to become the role model I wished for when I was <br>
                        younger. Please feel free to reach out with opportunities.<br><br>
                        
                        Skills: Front-end, Back-end, Graphic Design <br>
                        Languages: HTML, CSS, Java, Python <br>
